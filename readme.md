Today We've learned about MVC Pattern. MVC pattern help us to organize our code. 
     


MVC full meaning is Model, view, controller.   
* Model represent Database stuff
* Controller represent reltion between model and view
* View is viewing site for end user. 

Today We made 4 folder to split our project `controller` `core` `views` `public` We keep database related file inside `core` folder insetead `model` folder. Since real `model` different than our current database structure. 

We will keep our all `css` `js` `image` file inside public folder
